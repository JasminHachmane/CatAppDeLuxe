# CatDeluxe üê±‚ú®

Welcome to **CatDeluxe**, a fun iOS app where you can read and listen to amusing cat facts! This is my extra project to practice API integration, SwiftUI, and text-to-speech functionality. Perfect for cat lovers and anyone wanting a lighthearted break!



## What is CatDeluxe?

CatDeluxe fetches funny cat facts from an online API and presents them in a fresh, friendly design featuring soft pastel colors and cute cat emojis. You can save your favorite facts and listen to them with the built-in speech feature.



## Features

- **Async API data fetching:** Smooth and fast updates without blocking the UI.
- **Favorites:** Save your favorite cat facts for easy access later.

- **Playful UI:** Pastel colors and cat emojis create a cheerful vibe.
- **Easy navigation:** Switch between main screen, favorites, and viewed facts.

## Technical highlights

- Uses **MainActor** to safely update UI on the main thread.
